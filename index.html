working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://johnbaras.com/"> John S. Baras</a>,
Distinguished University Professor and Chair in Systems Engineering. 
Prior to that, he received his Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, 
where he worked as a research assistant at the Control Systems Lab <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/main/">(CSL)</a> with Prof.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/"> Kostas Kyriakopoulos</a>. 
His research interests include machine learning theory, stochastic optimization, systems and control theory, multi-agent systems, and robotics. </p>

<p> Since 2017, he has worked as a graduate research assistant at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, 
and as a research intern for the Math and Algorithms Research Group
