<h4> Short Bio </h4>

<p> Christos Mavridis received his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA,
working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://johnbaras.com/"> John S. Baras</a>,
Distinguished University Professor and Chair in Systems Engineering. 
Prior to that, he received his Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, 
where he worked as a research assistant at the Control Systems Lab <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/main/">(CSL)</a> with Prof.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/"> Kostas Kyriakopoulos</a>. 
His research interests include systems and control theory, optimization, learning theory, multi-agent systems, and robotics. </p>

<p> He is currently a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, and 
	has been a visiting postdoctoral fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm.
He has also worked as a research intern for the Math and Algorithms Research Group 
at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, NJ, USA
(advised by 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/irajsaniee/">Iraj Saniee</a>,
